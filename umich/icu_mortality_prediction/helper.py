    This function performs the following steps:
    - Reads in the data from data/labels.csv and data/files/*.csv (keep only the first 2,500 examples)
    - Generates a feature vector for each example
    - Aggregates feature vectors into a feature matrix (features are sorted alphabetically by name)
    - Performs imputation and normalization with respect to the population
    
    After all these steps, it splits the data into 80% train and 20% test. 
    
    The binary labels take two values:
        -1: survivor
        +1: died in hospital
    
    Returns the features and labels for train and test sets, followed by the names of features.
